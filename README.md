# C-Git-Commands

Welcome to C Git Commands this is a project I'm working on to bring easy execution of git commands for the C Language. 
I will be adding as many command supports as I can and try to make sure there are no bug. Please feel free to report any issue or ask for any specific feature.
And if you want to add them yourself go ahead!

## C Git - Git C

The object of Git is to bring easy git commands to c developers who, for whatever reason, may want to do it. 

currently to execute git commands in c for when a git command has multiple options, there is two functions for most commands. Like `git init` has a function `gitInit();` and `gitInitDir();` with git init using the source directory of the executable, while git init dir requires a set directory.
